##Cross-platform and native
The app is implemented in two ways in order to demonstrate the two different approaches to Xamarin app development:
* Xamarin.Forms cross-platform UI
* Xamarin native, with platform-specific UI implementations

##Three platforms
The app targets three platforms:
* iOS
* Android
* Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
    * UWP currently only in Forms version of app
    * UWP supported only in Visual Studio, not Xamarin Studio
    
##Integrations
Includes integrations such as:
* getting directions
* making calls
* sending text messages
* email composition

## Requirements
* [Visual Studio __2015__](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/vs-2015-product-editions.aspx) (14.0 or higher) to compile C# 6 langage features (or Xamarin Studio OS X)
* Xamarin add-ons for Visual Studio (available via the Visual Studio installer)
* __Visual Studio Community Edition is fully supported!__

## Google Maps API key (Android)
For Android, you'll need to obtain a Google Maps API key:
https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/android/platform_features/maps_and_location/maps/obtaining_a_google_maps_api_key/

Insert it in the Android project: `~/Properties/AndroidManifest.xml`:

    <application ...>
      ...
      <meta-data android:name="com.google.android.geo.API_KEY" android:value="GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY" />
      ...
    </application>

## Enabling SQLite for UWP

The UWP app requires that you install the SQLite for UWP extension for Visual Studio. You can find the latest version here:
https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/4913e7d5-96c9-4dde-a1a1-69820d615936

The steps that were taken to implement it in the UWP project can be found in steps 1-3 here:

## Platform-specific UI Features (in native version only)
| 3D Touch Previewing (iOS) | Shared View Transitions (Android) |
